# Toxic-gas-sensor

The repository contains code for a low cost toxic gas detection which provides detailed information on the detection and prevention of toxic gas accidents in salt wells of Kutch region. The authors of this PDF conducted a literature search and field visit to provide insights on the harmful gases generated in salt wells and the challenges faced by salt farmers in accessing toxic gas sensing systems. During their field visit, they talked to a group of salt farmers and one survivor for understanding the before and after effects of such accidents. 
Although there is no specific study on Kutch area for this problem, there are reported incidents of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulphide poisoning in other wells and sewages across the globe. The authors also discussed the possibility of a first-hand measure for providing little extra escape time to the person inside the well if a positive alarm is triggered and gas is detected. They made a simple gas mask using membrane cloth and activated charcoal, which is an effective H2S adsorbent. It can easily be replicated by anyone at home and is also very economic.
The details about the report and analysis can be found on the [SRISTI-UNICEF Summer School 2017 page](https://www.ss.sristi.org/post/detection-and-prevention-of-toxic-gas-accidents-in-salt-wells-of-kutch-region)
